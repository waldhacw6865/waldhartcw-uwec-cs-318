        <h2>Guinea pig care tips</h2>
        <p>Caring for guinea pigs involves meeting their basic needs for food, space, and mental stimulation. First, provide a spacious cage with plenty of room for them to move around, as well as a clean, dry bedding like hay or paper-based materials. Guinea pigs are herbivores, so their diet should primarily consist of fresh hay, high-quality pellets, and fresh vegetables like bell peppers, lettuce, and carrots. They also require access to clean water at all times. To keep them healthy, make sure they get enough exercise outside of the cage, ideally in a safe, guinea pig-proofed area. Regular grooming is necessary, especially for long-haired breeds. Guinea pigs are social animals, so consider having at least two to prevent loneliness. Most importantly, schedule regular vet check-ups to monitor their health.</p>
