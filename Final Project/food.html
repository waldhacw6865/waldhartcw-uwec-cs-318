            <h2>The Importance of a Balanced Diet</h2>
            <p>Guinea pigs require a balanced diet to stay healthy and active. Their diet should primarily consist of fresh hay, which aids in digestion and keeps their teeth healthy. High-quality guinea pig pellets can also provide essential nutrients.</p>

            <h2>Fresh Vegetables and Fruits</h2>
            <p>Fresh vegetables are a vital part of a guinea pig's diet. Leafy greens like romaine lettuce, kale, and parsley are excellent choices. You can also offer small amounts of fruits like apples or strawberries as occasional treats, but avoid sugary or acidic fruits.</p>

            <h2>Vitamin C is Essential</h2>
            <p>Guinea pigs cannot produce their own vitamin C, so it's crucial to include foods rich in this nutrient. Bell peppers, broccoli, and oranges are great sources of vitamin C. Alternatively, you can provide vitamin C supplements if needed.</p>
