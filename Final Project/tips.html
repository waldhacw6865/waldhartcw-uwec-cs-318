            <h2>Keep Their Environment Clean</h2>
            <p>Regularly clean your guinea pig's cage to ensure a healthy and hygienic environment. Remove soiled bedding daily and perform a deep clean of the cage at least once a week. Use safe, non-toxic cleaning products to avoid harming your pet.</p>

            <h2>Provide Fresh Water and Food</h2>
            <p>Always ensure your guinea pig has access to fresh, clean water. Use a water bottle with a sipper tube to keep the water free from contamination. Refill their food bowl daily with fresh hay, pellets, and vegetables to maintain a balanced diet.</p>

            <h2>Handle with Care</h2>
            <p>Guinea pigs are delicate animals and should be handled gently. Always support their body when picking them up, and avoid sudden movements that might scare them. Spend time bonding with your guinea pig to build trust and make them feel secure.</p>

            <h2>Enrichment and Playtime</h2>
            <p>Provide toys, tunnels, and hideouts to keep your guinea pig mentally stimulated. Schedule daily playtime outside their cage in a safe, enclosed area. This helps them stay active and prevents boredom.</p>
